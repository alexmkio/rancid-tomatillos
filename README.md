# Rancid Tomatillos

Rancid Tomatillos was a Mod 3 paired project in the Front End program at the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/). The assignment was to build out a multi-page application using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Router](https://reactrouter.com/). We used [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) and [PropTypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) to test user stories and our data model.

The project spec can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/rancid-tomatillos-v3.html).

Our project is deployed on [Heroku](https://tomatillos-2021.herokuapp.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://alexmkio.github.io/rancid-tomatillos/#/).

## Contributors

This application was built by [Lauren Kessell](https://github.com/LKessell) and [Alex Kio](https://github.com/alexmkio/); Front End Engineering, Mod 3 students at the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/).

## Technologies Used

This application was built using the [React](https://reactjs.org/) javascript framework. [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) and [PropTypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) were used to test user stories and our data model. GitHub and Git are used for version control and collaboration. HTTP Request is being used to Get inside of an async await function.

## The Evolution of the Project

We started this project by creating a living ["DTR document"](https://gist.github.com/alexmkio/0255d484206a058245d9c0dabaefc373) in which we discussed each other's learning goals, preferred working style, personal schedules, communication preferences, etc. We then started to digest the [project spec and rubric](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/rancid-tomatillos-v3.html), and came up with an [outline](https://gist.github.com/alexmkio/655c87daf975a46483119ce85c575e3f) of what we thought the project needed. We then conducted research on some similar applications and established our [wireframes](https://lkessell.invisionapp.com/freehand/Tomatillos-UoeK1zaPE). We then created this GitHub repo and initialized it with a [PR template](https://github.com/alexmkio/rancid-tomatillos/blob/main/pull_request_template.md) and a [project board](https://github.com/alexmkio/rancid-tomatillos/projects/1). We turned every user story from the project spec into issues and associated them with our project board. We then tackled the project spec one iteration and user story at a time. We preferred to divy up the work and work independently with frequent check-ins. Our [pull request history](https://github.com/alexmkio/rancid-tomatillos/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Acreated-asc) is a good example of our workflow and communication habits.
